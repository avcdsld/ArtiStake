name: TSUBAKI Revolution
description: >-
  A revolution is rising in Sagiura, a quiet village northwards Izumo, Shimane Prefecture. Not of regime change, but one that promises humanity’s recall back into nature. Here, Atsuo Shiga is uncovering the secrets of the Camellia, also known as Tsubaki in Japan. And through his Tsubaki Revolution, Shiga is changing the face of Izumo, reconnecting the region with its roots in the Camellia flower, and, consequently, people with nature.

  The destined meeting of Shiga and Camellia
  The love story began when Shiga returned from the United States to create a circular economy in Izu Oshima, an island southeast of Shizuoka Prefecture. He learned that Camellias were offered as tribute to the gods in ancient times, replacing the rice tributes that were common in other regions.

  “I want to give it my all with whatever time I have in this world. Although Camellia began as a research subject, I decided to dedicate my time to Camellia.”

  Subsequently, he joined in the revitalization efforts in Kesennuma Oshima, Tohoku. There, he discovered how Camellia oil could act as a catalyst to revive local tourism, of the lessons which he would then apply in Izumo.

  Economic, historical and cultural presence of Camellia through the ages
  Shiga searched for a place to use the above wisdom and found Izumo, home to the famous Izumo-taisha and. As it turns out, Camellia was naturally grown here and was valuable throughout Izumo’s history, its value waned in modern times, now rediscovered by Shiga.
