aboutMyWork: >-
  "I'm currently working on Himé Designs project started in March 2021, where I
  used my specialised skill-set and professional training, to craft my character
  designs called Himé (御姫）for collectors to love, own, collect, use, resell or
  invest. A mix of fine arts and collectibles, Himé Designs is one of the very
  first projects in the NFT space to introduce anime-style artworks and
  distribution of commercial-use licenses.


  Himé Designs is named after the word 'ohimesama' meaning 'princess' in
  Japanese, because I believe my collectors deserve more than 'waifus'; my
  collectors deserve princesses!


  Each 1 of 1 design comes with a commercial-use license to use for anything.
  Owner of the NFT will have the permission to use the design, and any iteration
  of the design for profit. "
