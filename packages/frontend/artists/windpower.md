name: Wind Power
description: >-
  Wind power or wind energy is mostly the use of wind turbines to generate electricity. Historically, wind power has been used in sails, windmills and windpumps. Wind power is a popular, sustainable, renewable energy source that has a much smaller impact on the environment than burning fossil fuels. Wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines, which are connected to the electric power transmission network.

  Wind power or wind energy is mostly the use of wind turbines to generate electricity. Historically, wind power has been used in sails, windmills and windpumps. Wind power is a popular, sustainable, renewable energy source that has a much smaller impact on the environment than burning fossil fuels. Wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines, which are connected to the electric power transmission network.The Wind Power is a comprehensive database of detailed raw statistics on the rapidly growing sphere of wind energy and its supporting markets.
  
  The Wind Power tabulates data from a variety of players in the worldwide industry — wind farm developers, operators and owners, turbine manufacturers, to name only a few — into useable figures available in Excel, Csv, Tsv, Shape, Kmz and Kml formats.
  
  Our database provides direct and immediate access to information about regions, countries, manufacturers, types and numbers of turbines, hub heights, MWs/GWs, developers, operators, owners, and commissioning dates.
  
  We include not only large, high-profile projects, but also the smaller, independent ones.
