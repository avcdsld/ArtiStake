description: Fine Art Photographer
aboutMyWork:　""Hiroaki Hasumi has been wondering what humans are born for. He was a motorcycle test driver and working hard. He thought it was a right job for him. Thanks to the job, he was lucky to find the meaning of his existence from the early days. But there was always danger in this job. He had passed through many dangers on several occasions and had a brush with death. Every time he experienced the danger, some miraculous power occurred and helped him out the danger. And then he heard someone’s voice, saying, “Not now. You still have a lot of things to do. Don’t die.” Eventually, he got an opportunity to see fine art photography. He thought it was a gift from God. It might be his new role to contribute to people with photography and be a chance to move on to the next stage. When he takes photographs, he tries to find hidden spirituality of Japanese in the object. His creative style is greatly influenced by his mysterious experiences which he had been through.
