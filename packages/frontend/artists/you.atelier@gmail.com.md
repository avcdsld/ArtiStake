  I started working in the visual art industry in 2006.

  I've always wanted a way to share the light I feel when I close my eyes with

  His work is always strongly connected with “memory”.

  Memory is an important element to identify who I am . But at the same time,
  it’s a wall which limits your imagination. Always trying to realize we have
  the same memory from a very old era. This is why he set his artist name as
  YOU. His work will be finalized inside your soul.
