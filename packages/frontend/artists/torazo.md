aboutMyWork: First of all, I think that a moment when you are freed from various shackles comes from the creation. In my case, the work is often taken from my life experience, and it is often reflected in the work that it receives stimulation quickly to the power and the color which becomes a motif momentarily instantly. My thought, the motif and things that you want to draw slowly in a little long period of time intersect in the body and overlap in the corner of the head, and the image painting spills. It means that my sensibility and experience is stimulated by external stimuli, and it is a based in material for create my works.
