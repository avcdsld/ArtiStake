name: Reforestation
description: >-
  Reforestation can be defined as the process of replanting trees in areas that have been affected by natural disturbances like wildfires, drought, and insect and disease infestations — and unnatural ones like logging, mining, agricultural clearing, and development. This can mean anything from supporting natural regeneration in an area that has been degraded to planting ecologically appropriate tree seedlings after forest fires.

  HOW REFORESTATION HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT
  
  By planting trees in areas that have been degraded or deforested, reforestation helps the environment by guaranteeing, or accelerating the re-establishment of healthy forest structure by regrowing the forest canopy and preserving biodiversity within the ecosystem.
  
  REFORESTATION BENEFITS
  Helps carbon sequestrationby fixing atmospheric carbon dioxide in their leaves, trunks, and roots
  Removes air pollutants by absorbing them into their leaves and bark
  Prevents soil erosion by growing roots that hold the soil together
  Provides habitat for over 80% of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity
  Acts as natural air conditioners by reducing ambient air temperatures by up to 8° Celsius
  Reduces the impact of global warming and climate change
  Helps to protect endangered species
  Filters our drinking water through their roots
  Prevents floods and landslides by absorbing water and slowly releasing it via transpiration
