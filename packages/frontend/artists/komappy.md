name: KOMAPPY
description: Digital Artist based in Japan. In my work, I mainly produce motion graphics and VFX for TV commercials and promotional videos.
aboutMyWork: I make artworks to share my "love" with others.
I want to make a variety of things, so my works may look inconsistent, but they are all unified by the feeling of "love".
