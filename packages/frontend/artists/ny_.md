aboutMyWork: I have been creating "moving black ink paintings" since 2010. This is a video displayed in a frame. In order to express myself, I use "traditional Japanese black ink", an originally developed "application", and "3DCG" using my animation skills. The same method is used to make and display my CryptoArt. I am challenging to create a new value by giving a permanent existence value as a "thing" to the temporary existence of "video".
